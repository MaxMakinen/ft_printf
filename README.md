# ft_printf
My own implementation of printf, done as schoolwork for Hive helsinki.
Gives most of the functionality of printf.

The assignment was very limiting and in file "libft" you'll find many stdlib functions that I have also personally implemented.

*make* compiles all files and produces a lib file:"libftprintf.a" that makes use of lib file:"libft.a" produced in the libft file.

*make clean* removes all .o files from src and libft.

*make fclean* removes all .o files from src and libft, as well as the libftprintf.a and libft.a files.
